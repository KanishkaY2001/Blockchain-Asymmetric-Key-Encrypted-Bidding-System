# COMP6451 NeverPay Bidding System
A signed-certificate authenticated bidding system which enables users to securely place Ethereum bids using asymmetric key encryption.

## Interaction Summary
The interaction between these entities is such that ASIC is an established organization which has created a registry system through which financial organizations may apply in order to become a trusted certification issuer and exist within this registry. Becoming a certification issuer allows this organization to generate legal certificates for investors to prove that they are sophisticated, demonstrated by their abundance of assets or high income. Whereas investors are those who are seeking to support and fund companies to eventually create a profitable investment but must first gain a status of being sophisticated. Such a company is the start-up Fintech NeverPay, which is deciding to organize an equity fundraising to collect funds through the Ethereum platform.

As such, the interaction begins with a regular investor seeking to become a sophisticated investor by contacting their financial organization. This organization will provide the certificate that proves this status, and the investor may now interact with the Ethereum platform to participate in NeverPay’s fundraiser. NeverPay, however, must ensure that this investor has the sophisticated status by interacting with ASIC’s registry, which validates the investor’s certificate. Thus, the investor is eligible to participate and purchase shares.

As financial organizations do not wish to operate on the blockchain, they are not required to interact with other entities, but rather, are only required to provide ASIC with a public key that may be identified by a private key
